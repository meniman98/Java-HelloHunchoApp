# Java-HelloHunchoApp
A quick starting guide on using spring booty

# Welcome
You might ask what is this. Great question. People make hello world applications, I make hello Huncho applications.

Anyway lets explain what's done here


Clone this bad boy, open up the maven file, and hit run. Upon running, navigate to localhost:8080/greeting and you shall see a nice greeting message.
Alternatively you can do localhost:8080/greeting?name=CactusJack and the app will respond with ```Hello there CactusJack!``` pretty cool isn't it?
